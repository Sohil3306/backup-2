# Setup Instructions for React Survey Data Analysis Tool

## üöÄ Option 1: Node.js Setup (Recommended)

### Install Node.js
1. **Download Node.js** from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Choose LTS version** (recommended for stability)
3. **Run the installer** and follow the setup wizard
4. **Verify installation** by opening a new terminal/command prompt:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

### Run the React Application
1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd D:\statathon
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## üåê Option 2: CDN Version (No Node.js Required)

If you don't want to install Node.js, I can create a CDN-based version that runs entirely in the browser. This would use:

- React from CDN
- All libraries from CDN
- Single HTML file with embedded JavaScript

Would you like me to create this CDN version instead?

## üì¶ Option 3: Build and Deploy

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Static Hosting
The `build` folder can be deployed to:
- **Netlify** - Drag and drop the build folder
- **Vercel** - Connect your GitHub repository
- **GitHub Pages** - Upload the build folder
- **Any web server** - Copy build folder to web root

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Node.js Installation Issues
1. **Windows**: Download from official website, run as administrator
2. **Mac**: Use Homebrew: `brew install node`
3. **Linux**: Use package manager or NodeSource repository

### npm Issues
1. **Clear npm cache**: `npm cache clean --force`
2. **Update npm**: `npm install -g npm@latest`
3. **Check permissions**: Run terminal as administrator

### Port Issues
If port 3000 is busy:
```bash
npm start -- --port 3001
```

## üìã Quick Test

To verify everything is working:

1. **Check Node.js installation:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

2. **Check npm installation:**
   ```bash
   npm --version
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üéØ Alternative: CDN Version

If you prefer not to install Node.js, I can create a single HTML file that includes all the functionality using CDN links. This would be:

- **Single file** - No build process
- **No installation** - Just open in browser
- **All features** - Same functionality as React version
- **Portable** - Can be shared as a single file

Would you like me to create this CDN version?
